# Domain Classification Analysis

## Domain List
The system needs to classify user questions into the following software development domains:

1. **Github** - Version control, repositories, pull requests, issues, actions
2. **Jenkins** - CI/CD pipelines, builds, automation
3. **Artifactory** - Binary repository management, artifact storage
4. **SonarScan** - Code quality, static analysis, security scanning
5. **API** - API development, documentation, testing, management
6. **Terraform** - Infrastructure as code, provisioning
7. **EKS** - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, container orchestration
8. **AWS** - Amazon Web Services, cloud infrastructure
9. **Azure** - Microsoft's cloud platform
10. **Cloud Security** - Security practices for cloud environments
11. **Secret Management** - Managing credentials, keys, certificates
12. **ALMx** - Application Lifecycle Management

## Classification Challenges

1. **Overlapping Domains**: Many questions could span multiple domains (e.g., "How to set up Jenkins pipeline for AWS deployment" involves both Jenkins and AWS)

2. **Ambiguous Terminology**: Terms like "repository" could refer to Github or Artifactory depending on context

3. **Varying Specificity**: Questions may range from very specific ("How to configure Jenkins webhook for Github") to very general ("Best practices for cloud security")

4. **Domain Knowledge Requirements**: Effective classification requires understanding of software development concepts and tools

## LLM Classification Approach

Using an LLM like OpenAI's models for domain classification offers several advantages:

1. **Semantic Understanding**: LLMs can understand the meaning and intent behind questions, not just keyword matching

2. **Context Awareness**: LLMs can consider the full context of a question to determine the most relevant domain

3. **Confidence Scoring**: LLMs can provide confidence levels for classifications, enabling fallback mechanisms

4. **Multi-label Classification**: LLMs can identify multiple relevant domains when appropriate

5. **Zero-shot Learning**: LLMs can classify without extensive training data by leveraging pre-trained knowledge
